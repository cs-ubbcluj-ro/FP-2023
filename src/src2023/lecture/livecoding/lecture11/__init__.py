Programming paradigms
    1. Procedural programming = program is collection of functions that
    talk to each other (functions with parameters and return types), we had
    UI and non-UI section in program

    2. Modular programming = procedural programming + modules (UI module,
    functions module)

    3. Object-oriented programming = program is a bunch of objects that
    talk to each other
        fundamentals of OOP
        - encapsulation (we bundle fields and methods together and protect
        access to them)
        - inheritance (ex: define new Exception types, unittest.TestCase,
        implement File-backed repositories)
        - polymorphism (the function that runs is decided at runtime, not at
        compile time -> it's always like this in Python)

    4. Layered architecture = design pattern (a recipe for solving problems
     that show up again and again...)

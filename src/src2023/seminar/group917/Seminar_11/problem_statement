Create an application for task management using a console based user interface.
The application must allow keeping records of the companyâ€™s list of persons, list of tasks and the assignments of tasks to persons.
The application must allow its users to manage persons, tasks and assignments in the following ways:

Tasks:
    Add a task. Each task has a unique ID, and is characterized by a description, by a deadline date, and by a status.
    Remove a task.
    Filter tasks based on substring contained in description.
    Print report of existing tasks by date.
    *Search for tasks based on deadline day, month, or status.
        e.g. search_tasks deadline_day = 12, deadline_month, status = pending
             search_tasks deadline_day = 16, status = pending
             search_tasks status = in-progress
    Provide validation for tasks and corresponding operations.

Persons
    Add a person. Each person has a unique CNP, and also has a name.
    Remove a person.
    *Update person.
    Provide validation for persons and corresponding operations.

Assignments
    [A person can be assigned any number of tasks, and a task can be assigned to any number of people. An evaluation of
        the task must also be provided (a float number between 1 and 10).]
    Add assignment.
    Remove assignment.
    Provide validation for assignments and corresponding operations.


*Statistics
    The first N persons in terms of the number of tasks assigned.

*The application must have support for unlimited undo/redo with cascading.

Write PyUnit tests for implemented functionalities. *Determine the coverage of your tests.
